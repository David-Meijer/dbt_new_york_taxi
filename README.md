Project for learning DBT using the New York Taxi dataset.

1. Run download_files.py to download all the files from the New York Taxi dataset.
2. Run ingestion.py to ingest the files to a seperate 'raw' database (raw_database.duckdb) in the raw_files folder.
3. Build and run the DBT project -> a database file (database.duckdb) will be created in the dbt project folder.
